            <h2>Living with the F150 and R1T</h2>
            <p>Both trucks feature pin-drop-precise one-pedal braking modes. Should you need to use the brake pedal itself,
                the Ford's feels more natural. Where the two trucks most differentiate themselves on the road is in how they
                ride and steer. America's legions of full-size truck buyers will find familiar territory in the way the Ford
                goes down the road. Like the standard F-150, the Lightning's ride is somehow firm but floaty, shuddering slightly
                over harsher impacts like most body-on-frame trucks do. It's never punishing or harsh, but it couldn't feel more
                different than the Rivian. The R1T in its default All-Purpose drive mode is firm and well-controlled, almost like
                it's pushing back down into the road, attempting to flatten out the impacts it just encountered</p>
            <h2>R1T Off Road</h2>
            <p>Off-road, the Rivian is an order of magnitude more capable than the Ford. With five off-road modes (All-Purpose,
                Rock Crawl, Rally, Drift, and Sandâ€”the last a recent over-the-air update addition), there's very little that can
                stop an R1T off the pavement. Its height-adjustable suspension gives it a tremendous amount of ground clearance,
                while the hydraulic dampers help the Rivian keep all four all-terrains on earth. Its quad-motor system is incredibly
                impressive, too, combining the gearing of a low range, the traction of locking differentials, and the precision of
                electric motors to conquer the types of obstacles that'd make a Toyota Land Cruiser owner blush.</p>
            <h2>Lightning Off Road</h2>
            <p>The Ford isn't in its element off-road, but it's not necessarily out of place, either. The Lightning doesn't have the
                body control to move quickly when it's away from asphalt, but at slower speeds the truck comfortably ambles down
                hard-packed dirt and through loose sand. On more technical terrain, the F-150's rear diff-lock helps the truck
                maintain forward momentum, though it could use a locking front differential, too, as it tends to spin the driver-side
                 front wheel quite a bit. Trying to keep pace with the R1T will result in nothing but frustration and body damage,
                 but if you take things slow and choose your line carefully the Lightning will get you where you need to go.</p>
